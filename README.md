#About 
The bypass launcher is a project from late 2024 and early 2025. The purpose is to bypass school tracking software and give students the ability to bypass school software, especially ones that block websites. The project was discontinued on June 9th, 2025, but I am allowing users to fork this project with a creative commons lisence.

#Requirements
At least 600 megabytes of free storage and a chromium based browser (though it also works on firefox without about:blank technologies).
